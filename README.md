- Note that in this game we are only using vanilla JS, CSS, HTML to run the game.
- To run the game you should pull the file from the master and use any enviroment to run. recommended enviroments would be VS code / Jetbrains as that was what we used to code the project. 
- Note that you should also have a plugin installed that would allow you to live edit the file so that we can see the webpage from the code. 
- The game is a hangman game which consists of added variables such as a countdown timer that would increase the difficulty of the game. 
- There are also 3 different modes from. The three modes are easy,normal, and hard. These modes will decide how much time the player has to guess the correct word and how many lives the player would have for the round.
